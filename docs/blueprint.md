# **App Name**: Eco Bento Challenge

## Core Features:

- Bento Item Selection: Players select items from categories (side dishes, fruits, drinks, containers, snacks) with a 15-seed budget. The game prevents exceeding the budget. Each category must contain at least one item. Buying is allowed till the player exhausts 15 seeds. 
- Dice Roll Event: Players roll two dice to determine their action. Different numbers allow buying a product card. Matching numbers trigger a bonus card draw for all players.
- Bonus Card Draw: Players draw an 'environmental campaign' or 'plastic tax' bonus card on a dice match, adding or subtracting points based on card conditions.
- AI Recommendation Tool: Generative AI assists players to suggest items by scanning item data for optimizing taste, convenience, and environmental impact within budget constraints, with special regard to available bonus cards.
- Score Calculation: The app will automatically compute scores using taste, convenience, environmental points, and bonus card adjustments, determining the 'Sustainable Consumer,' 'Environmental Guardian,' and 'Economical Consumer' based on total, environmental, and spending scores respectively.
- Badge Display: Displays the badges earned, providing a summary of achievements to the player
- Virtual Player: Simulates the choices of other players to offer a competitive environment during a single player session.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#4CAF50) to evoke nature and sustainability.
- Background color: Light green (#E8F5E9), a very low saturation variation on the primary color.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFB300) to highlight important elements like scores and badges.
- Font: 'Alegreya', a serif font for an elegant, intellectual feel, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons representing each food category (side dish, fruit, drink, container, snack) and environmental themes.
- Card-based layout with clear sections for item details, points, and environmental impact.
- Subtle animations when dice are rolled or items are selected to provide user feedback.
